Thanks, Ben! That worked for me, for a long time!

But when, following Mike's advice, I upgraded from 0.5.4 to 0.6-dev [1], my TidalCustom.hs file (which is on Github [2]) broke.

When it was working, I had replaced this line:
  (tidal-send-string ":module Sound.Tidal.Context") ;; original
with this:
  (tidal-send-string ":load ~/git_play/Tidal/TidalCustom")
  (tidal-send-string ":module+ Sound.Tidal.Context")

If I try that now, Emcas shows this in the *tidal* buffer:

Any ideas?
