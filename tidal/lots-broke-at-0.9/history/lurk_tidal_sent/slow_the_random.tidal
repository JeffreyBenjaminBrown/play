The following produces a bassline with a random pitch:

  let randPitch = fromIntegral . floor . (*12) <$> rand
  d1 $ sd "bass" |*| up randPitch

Suppose you want the pitch to change only every 4 notes. It might seem reasonable to slow down the pitch instruction:

  d1 $ sd "bass" |*| (slow 4 $ up randPitch)

but the resulting sound is indistinguishable from the previous.

Is there a way?
