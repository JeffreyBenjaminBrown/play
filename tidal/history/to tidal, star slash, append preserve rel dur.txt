mixing * and /

These sound identical:
  d1 $ sound "bd*2 hh/2"
  d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "bd*2 hh bd*2 ~"

Preplace is beautiful! But what is the numeric pair argument for? To me it seems to have no effect.

append, append' and cat all disregard the relative lengths of the two loops.

mixing * and /

This expression:
  d1 $ sound "if*2 bd/2"
sounds identical to this one:
 d1 $ sound "if*2 bd/2"
