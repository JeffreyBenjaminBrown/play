composition riddles
===================
replace ? deleted some valid additive interpretations
add how much pitch info?
  I prefer inferring it to inventing it.

    considering the root in 3ish-note mel context is enough  

composition, methods, keeping
=============================
first play the melody unaccompanied, search for groups, timing
Don't write chords here until can hear _ far beyond.

=====================================
proc
  asked for "root 2 in base 10"
  after copying, verified 6 digits at a time
  these are the first four lines
    as appear in the browser when line length is at max
