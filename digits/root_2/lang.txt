rules
  leading s in () = lang change, serial melody in ()s
    rather than chord word outside the ()s
  (): so far all pitches in () are absolute, 
    not relv to the root preceding the ()
  ! In the chord line only
    entirely numeric words are concurrent two-notes
      except for _7 which is theorj ambig
        where _ is a digit

  lines (are double)
    The first in each pair is the melody.
    Under most melody lines is chords.

symbols
  single-note operators
    _ = postfix drop octave
    ' = postfix raise octave
  
  time
    (,) = these are to be played (faster) as one
    dc = da coda
      coda = the end after beginning a second time
      da = to? "da coda" is italian, I think, for 
        "go through the first part again"
    . = extra time, ?siginfiying promise fulfilled
        or the decimal point
  
  pitch
    r: relative to the pitch outside this ()
    t: postfix for "is tonic"
    ~ : glue, either chord applies
      ? isolating between two chords ?should have the same effect

    chord symbols
      M=major, m=minor, d = dim, hd = half dim
      pd = phrygian dominant = 0 1 4 5 7 8 10
      7 = mixolydian. (Sorry; this notation predates me.)
      x = mixolydian
      dr = dorian
