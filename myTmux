### USAGE
# Run
#   myTmux <server-name>
# where <server-name> is whatever I want to call that tmux server.
# This lets me maintain multiple tmux servers in different namespaces,
# and save and restore to each.
# For the default behavior (what you get when running `tmux` without args),
# provide no server name.
#
### A SOLUTION
# If I don't remember the server names on offer, run
#   find ~/.tmux/resurrect -type d
#
### HOW IT WORKS
# In ~/.tmux.conf there is a line that reads something like
#   set -g @resurrect-dir "~/.tmux/resurrect/subfolder"
# This changes the it to point to ~/.tmux/resurrect/$1,
# where $1 is the argument to this script.
# If no argument is given, it points to ~/.tmux/resurrect,
# which is the default launch behavior for tmux.
# It then launches a tmux server with that name.

sed -i "s/^.*resurrect-dir.*\$/set -g @resurrect-dir \"~\/\.tmux\/resurrect\/$1\"/g" ~/code/git_play/dot-tmux.conf

if test -n "$1"; then
  tmux -L $1 # Calls the session $1        and saves to ~/.tmux/resurrect/$1
else
  tmux       # Calls the session "default" and saves to ~/.tmux/resurrect
fi
