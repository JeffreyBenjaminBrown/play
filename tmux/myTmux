### USAGE
# Run
#   myTmux <server-name>
# where <server-name> is whatever I want to call that tmux server.
# This lets me maintain multiple tmux servers in different namespaces,
# and save and restore to each.
# For the default behavior (what you get when running `tmux` without args),
# provide no server name.
#
### A SOLUTION
# If I don't remember the server names on offer,
# just look at the names of the subfolders of
#   ~/.tmux/resurrect
#
### PITFALL
# The `sed` command changes a line of the Tmux config.
# That config only seems to matter when launching a Tmux server.
# That's why I can then change it to something else
# and launch a server under a different name.
#
### HOW IT WORKS
# In ~/.tmux.conf there is a line that reads something like
#   set -g @resurrect-dir "~/.tmux/resurrect/subfolder"
# This changes it to point to ~/.tmux/resurrect/$1,
# where $1 is the argument to this script.
# If no argument is given, it points to ~/.tmux/resurrect,
# which is the default launch behavior for tmux.
# It then launches a tmux server with that name.

sed -i --follow-symlinks "s/^.*resurrect-dir.*\$/set -g @resurrect-dir \"~\/\.tmux\/resurrect\/$1\"/g" ~/.tmux.conf

if test -n "$1"; then
  tmux -L $1 # Calls the session $1        and saves to ~/.tmux/resurrect/$1
else
  tmux       # Calls the session "default" and saves to ~/.tmux/resurrect
fi
